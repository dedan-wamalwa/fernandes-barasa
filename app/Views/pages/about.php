							<p class="mb-4">
								I was appointed the Managing Director at KETRACO whose mandate is to plan, design, construct, own, operate, and maintain Kenya’s high voltage electricity transmission grid and regional power interconnectors.
								I oversaw the formulation and launch of the company’s second Five-Year Strategic Plan through reinforcing, upgrading the power system, and increasing electricity access throughout the country as well as promoting power exchange and trade in the East Africa region.
								Through my leadership, below are milestone projects I oversaw during my tenure at KETRACO:
							</p>

							<p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 40px">
								<i>The 500 kV high voltage direct current (HVDC) line linking the power grids of Ethiopia and Kenya</i> that created power-sharing between the two countries, reduced energy costs and promoted sustainable and renewable power generation.
								It was the first HVDC line in East Africa and a major channel of outbound power transmission for Ethiopia. 
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 40px">
								<i>The energization of the 482Km 400kV Mombasa – Nairobi transmission line </i> in 2017 stabilized power within Nairobi and its environs.
								This included the Mariakani substation which is an essential part of the 482km 400/220kV Mombasa – Nairobi transmission line as it steps up the power to ensure it is transmitted over long distances thus reducing transmission losses.  
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 40px">
								In 2018, I successfully completed and energized the <i>435Km 400kV Loiyangalani – Suswa Transmission Line</i>, a mega project comprising of 999 towers,
								traversing seven counties namely Marsabit, Samburu, Laikipia, Nyandarua, Nakuru, Kajiado, and Narok. This project is lauded for evacuation of clean energy from the Lake Turkana Wind Farm and stabilizing the National Grid.  
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 40px">
								I completed and energized the <i>400/220/132kV Olkaria -Lessos – Kisumu Transmission Line</i> that has increased electricity access, reliability, and stability in the Western Kenya region.  
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 40px">
								I also launched the <i>400kV Kenya-Tanzania Project </i>, the groundbreaking of Ndhiwa Substation in Homa Bay, and part of the 132kV Sondu- Homa Bay-Awendo Transmission line project.   
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 40px">
								The successful completion and energization of the <i>328Km 220kV Rabai-Malindi-Garsen-Lamu and the 234Km 132kV Kindaruma Mwingi Garissa transmission line </i>projects in 2016.
								The projects enabled the first connection of Lamu and Garissa Counties to the National Grid.  
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 40px">
								The completion of <i>132kV Kindaruma-Mwingi-Garissa</i>, the energization of <i>220kV Rabai-Malindi- Garsen-Lamu line</i>.  
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								Under my leadership and in line with the Big4Agenda, the National Grid increased the electricity connectivity rate to over 70%, reaching over 8.6 Million Kenyans.
								The Transmission Infrastructure expanded from 330km to over 2, 704Km.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								My other notable achievements include overseeing the growth of KETRACO’s asset base from Ksh. 8.2 Billion to Ksh. 200 Billion as of 30th June 2021.
								I have been instrumental in key decision-making on project funding, national policy on acquisition of land for Right of Way,
								and implementation capacity enhancement mechanisms that are critical in the expansion of the National Grid in Kenya and within the region.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								I am the patron and founder of Barasa Foundation; a non-profit organization that has transformed the lives of residents of Kakamega County, emerging as one of the most impactful charity organizations within the Western Kenya region.
								The foundation was born out of the challenges I witnessed and experienced growing up in Khabondi Village, in Mumias East constituency. 
								I can therefore relate to all the problems that I try to address through the foundation.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								With the invaluable help of the community and the foundation, I have been able to positively transform the lives of our people through various impactful projects.
								My flagship project through the foundation targeted the rampant problem of youth unemployment in the county. 
								I facilitated over 200 youth drawn from the 12 sub-counties of Kakamega County with motorbikes to participate in the "Bodaboda" transport business which has translated to millions of shillings annually to the economy.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								Through the foundation, I fully sponsored football tournaments for both boys and girls, which identified and nurtured football talents in Kakamega County. 
								Talented players were unearthed at the first edition of the Barasa Foundation Championship Cup, a case example being Violet Wanyonyi, who plays for Vihiga Queens and Harambee Starlets.
								Other notable projects that I have implemented include the interdenominational choir competition, the anti-jigger campaign, relief aid to floods victims, bursaries for needy students, umbrellas for market traders, and seed capital for social groups in Kakamega County.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								In the health sector, I have organized free medical camps including anti jigger campaigns, breast cancer clinics as well as the free medical eye clinic that diagnosed and treated 4913 patients; with 1753 patients receiving specialized eyeglasses to aid in their vision between October and November 2021.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								I have also been at the forefront of providing decent housing to deserving and vulnerable families whereby a total of 78 houses have been constructed through my efforts and those of my selfless partners.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								I, therefore, seek your support through this journey of transforming lives.

						<label for="section3" class="accordion__label">	Why I want to be the second Governor of Kakamega County</label>
						<div class="accordion__content">
							<p class="mb-4">
								I wore my first pair of shoes on my first day in form one and the school provided three square meals in a day. In primary school, I had no shoes and lunch was sugar cane and water. 
								Having grown up from these humble backgrounds and rising above struggles that most of us undergo, I am the most suitable candidate to take over as Kakamega Governor. Kakamega County deserves an experienced leader with integrity and vision to offer good governance. 
								Having managed big projects with a national outlook, I believe I am the most suitable candidate that can steer Kakamega County to even greater heights.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								As one of Kenya’s leading accountants and auditors as well as being a former Chairman of Institute of Chartered Institute of Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK), I have blazed the trail from very humble beginnings to the top of my career, becoming the longest-serving CEO in the energy sector due to sheer hard work and persistence. 
								My humble background, experience in matters of national discourse, public finance management, risk management, and corporate governance among others would come in handy in managing the county affairs and taking Kakamega County to the next level.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								It is, therefore, a true mark of humility and testament of my fervent desire to give back to my beloved home county that I have offered myself for election to Kakamega residents as their second Governor.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-4">
								Being a solid and competent professional whose mantra is “do the right thing and everything else will fall into place”, I beseech Kakamega County residents to count on me to turn around their economy once they elect me as their second governor. 
								Having taken KETRACO’s procurement to 100 percent paperless, making it the first company to implement automation in the East and Central Africa region, cutting operational costs, and killing corruption, Kakamega County residents can look forward to better days ahead if they elect me as their second governor.
